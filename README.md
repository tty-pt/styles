# @tty-pt/styles
> Cast your styles like a (good) wizard

This is a library designed to help you build your react app more easily.
Without declaring many styles locally (in the components or the views).
This way, you can quickly configure your layout presentation from a single source of truth.
And hopefully you will have a bit less code to maintain.
I hope you have fun.

## Installation
```sh
npm i --save-dev @tty-pt/styles # if you are developing a library add it also as a peer dependency.
```

## Simple Example
```js
import React from "react";
import { useCast, withMagic } from "@tty-pt/styles";

function App() {
	const c = useCast();

	// the div will have a padding of 16px
	// and its children will be separated by 16px
	return (<>
		<div className={c("horizontal pad")}>
			<span>1</span>
			<span>2</span>
			<span>3</span>
		</div>
	</>):
}

export default withMagic(App);
```
No matter how deep your component is,
you can always useCast().

## Customizing spells
```js
import React from "react";
import { useCast, withMagic, makeMagicBook } from "@tty-pt/styles";
import { createTheme } from "@material-ui/core";

const theme = createTheme({
	status: {
		success: "#00ff00",
	}
});

function getMagicBook(theme) {
	const magicBook = makeMagicBook(theme);

	return {
		...magicBook,
		// to modify the horizontal spell like this is actually not recommended.
		// and it is just here to tell you that you can modify existing spells.
		horizontal: {
			...magicBook.horizontal,
			gap: "12px",
		},
		colorStatusSuccess: { // this is a new spell
			color: theme.palette.status.success,
	        }
	}
}

function App() {
	const c = useCast();
	return (<div className={c("horizontal")}>
		<span>hello<span>
		<span className={c("colorStatusSuccess")}>world<span>
	</div>):
}

function withTheme(Component) {
	return function InnerComponent(props) {
		<Component theme={theme} />
	};
}

export default withTheme(withMagic(App, getMagicBook));
```
This library is designed to be compatible with material-ui.
There are other lower level APIs as well.
We will attempt to generate more extensive documentation in the future.

## Labels and values

### axis
Axis can be horizontal or vertical. In some situations it can be omitted (meaning all axis).

### size
Size can be the default (unit) size, which is usually when the label is omitted.
It can also be small (half) or big (double), smallest (a fourth) or biggest (quadruple).
Size can also be 0. When you apply "neg" after the size label, it negates the value.

### position
Position can be relative or absolute

### Special Position (the position keyword)
There is also a sort of position for setting the element to the top, to the right, etc.
This will be discussed later.

### direction
Direction can be top, left, right or bottom.

### align
Align can be stretch, center, end (meaning flex-end) or start (meaning flex-start).
If you hide this label, it usually means stretch.

### justify
This label might mean spaceBetween, center, start (meaning flex-start) and end (meaning flex-end).
If you hide it it means center.

### textAlign
This can be "left", "right" or "center".

### cursor
This can be "resize", "horizontal\<horizontalCursor\>" or "vertical\<verticalCursor\>".

### horizontalCursor
This can be "resize" meaning "ew-resize".

### horizontalCursor
This can be "resize" meaning "ns-resize".

### color
Color can be inherit, which is the default. it can also be black or white.
In fact all of the colors of the palette of MUI can be used.
The default is "main" in cases where the color is divided. But you can also specify "light".

### tableLayout
This can only be "fixed" for now. This is the default.

### fontWeight
This can only be "bold" for now, meaning 600. This is the default.

### angle
This can be piOverTwo. Default.

## Default Spells
> Spells are camelCased words that appear in the string that you give to "c" as an argument.
> They can be inspired on CSS property keys and values, although this is not the case all the time.
> Beware that this is based on a promise, and some of these spells might not work in certain combinations yet (this library is still a work in progress).

### 0: \<axis\>[\<size\>[neg]]
> Display this element with its children along \<axis\>, separated by \<size\>.

### 1: block[\<axis\>][\<size\>[neg]]
> The same as 0 but does not use flex

### 2: table[\<axis\>][\<size\>[neg]]
> The same as 0 but for tables

### 4: pad[\<axis\>][\<size\>]
> Add padding to this element in \<axis\> direction, of size \<size\>.

### 5: flexGrow[Children]
> This sets the element (or the element's children) to have a flex-grow property of 1.

### 6: flexWrap
> Use this in conjunction with 0.

### 6: \<position\>
> Sets the position of the element to the label (meaning relative or absolute).

### 7: position\<direction\>[\<size\>[neg]]
> Place the element in the specified \<direction\>, far from the edge by \<size\>.
> For use with absolute positioning and the like.

### 8: alignSelf[\<align\>]
> This sets the element's property of align-self to the value of \<align\>.

### 9: alignItems[\<align\>]
> This sets the element's property of align-items to the value of \<align\>.

### 10: justifyContent[\<justify\>]
> This sets the element's property of justifyContent to the value of \<justify\>.

### 11: size[\<axis\>][\<size\>]
> This sets the element's size to be \<size\> in the specified axis.
> In this specific case, \<size\> can also be "full" meaning "100%".

### 12: textAlign[\<textAlign\>]
> This sets the element's textAlign property to the value of \<textAlign\>.

### 13: margin[\<axis\>][\<size\>[neg]]
> I'm sure you can guess it at this point. I don't recomend using margins very often.

### 14: cursor[\<cursor\>]
> Now the labels have the most important information.

### 15: color[\<color\>]
> Sets the color property of the element.

### 15: background[\<color\>]
> Sets the background-color property of the element.

### 16: border[\<direction\>|\<axis\>][\<color\>]
> Sets the border in the specified direction or axis to be of the specified color.

### 17: tableLayout[\<tableLayout\>]
> Set the element's table-layout property to the specified \<tableLayout\>.

### 18: fontWeight[\<fontWeight\>]
> Set the element's font-weight property to the specified \<fontWeight\>.

### 19: rotate[\<angle\>]
> Rotate this element by \<angle\>

## Building
You can build this library by using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) instead of npm.

Clone this repo, cd into its directory. and "pnpm i".

To build in production mode:
```sh
pnpm build
```

And to start webpack watch:
```sh
pnpm watch
```

I think that's the most important.
